# Resume Matching System with Gemini Pro and Flask
## Overview

This repository houses the development of an advanced Resume Matching System according to ATS standards, utilizing cutting-edge technologies such as Gemini Pro and Flask.. The system was designed to facilitate a seamless comparison between candidate resumes and job descriptions, ensuring a high degree of accuracy in aligning candidate skills with specific job criteria. Leveraging Flask, I developed a robust web application for the deployment of this system, allowing users to input job descriptions dynamically. The system employed sophisticated algorithms based on Acceptance Tests (ATs) to automate the comparison process, providing users with a percentage match result. 

## Features

- **Gemini Pro Integration:** Utilizing Gemini Pro, the system ensures accurate and efficient comparison of candidate resumes against specified job criteria.

- **Flask Deployment:** The project includes a Flask-based web application for seamless deployment, allowing users to dynamically input job descriptions and receive instant match results.

## How It Works

1. **Input Job Descriptions:** Users can input job descriptions through the user-friendly web interface powered by Flask.

2. **Upload the Resume:** Users can upload the resume through the user-friendly web interface powered by Flask. 

3. **Automated Comparison:** The system utilizes Gemini Pro to compare candidate resumes against the provided job criteria.

4. **Percentage Match Result:** Users receive a detailed percentage match result, providing insights into the alignment between candidate skills and job requirements.
